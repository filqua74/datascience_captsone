This shiny application has been done as an assignment for the Capstone Project of the
Coursera Data Science specialization.

Given a text written by the user, the application predicts the likely next word. It
uses ngram language models ( up to trigrams ) and a backoff model ( supported by
good-turing smoothing ).
